<h2>Overview</h2>
This class is an introduction to learning how to use software such as Photoshop, InDesign, Premiere, as well as exploring the language of HTML. We learn how to best capture photography and video too. So far my favorite part of this class has been learning how to use HTML to create our own websites. </p>
